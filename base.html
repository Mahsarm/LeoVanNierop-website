                        I am a particle physicist turned data scientist, 
                        and this website is part of this transition. My field of study was on the interface of particle physics and cosmology. 
                        In particular, together with my supervisor, Cliff Burges, and co-student (is that a word?) Matt Williams, we attempted to 
                        tackle the Cosmological Constant problem. For those not in the know: the cosmological constant is a parameter in our model for the
                        universe that drives the universe to expand faster and faster. It has been measured by looking at the velocities of distant galaxies. 
                        It can also be predicted by calculating the energy of empty space (which, in quantum mechanics, is not zero). The problem, then, is 
                        that the calculated value is about 40 orders of magnitude (10000000000000000000000000000000000000000 times) larger than the measured 
                        value. For a good review about the problem, and some notes on our take on a solution, check out this paper (very math-y, be warned).
                        After trying my hand at academic research I have found that such a career is cool to talk about, but for me ultimately unsatisfactory. 
                        This is why I have been looking into a career that involves building or improving a product that will be actively used by
                        (hopefully many) customers. When (fingers crossed) I acquire a work permit, I will start working at Massuni custom furniture design.
                        Look at the demo, it is really cool! I'll wait for you, don't worry.
                        Now that we are all on the same page (you did watch the video, didn't you?), that is what I will be spending the majority of my time
                        on for the foreseeable future. This leaves me in a position where I have to quickly get familiar with a whole technology stack for 
                        dynamical websites. Luckily for me, 
                        Django was developed in an environment with harsh deadlines,
                        so it was made mainly to get things done, NOW! If you are also looking for a place to start with web development,
                        and you are partial to Python (or impartial to programming languages), a good place to start is the Django homepage, do the tutorial, 
                        and then work through the docs. </div>

                        and I have about zero pictures of them. The main reason for that is that when I am doing something I like, 
                        why would I then waste time spent on enjoying myself by taking pictures? From that statement, of course, you know photography 
                        is not one of those hobbies...
                        One constant in my free time is that I love playing games. Computer games, board games, card games: everything. 
                        I especially have a sweet spot for strategic games. I am a long time (on and off) fan of Magic. I have spent more hours on Skyrim
                        then I dare to recount (hence the skyrim alchemy app in my links: a practise project to get the hang of things).
                        I used to be an avid ping pong player, but this has taken a back seat the last few years mostly due to frequent moving. 
                        I intent to at least look into the options of picking that up again once I am settled in Toronto.
                        I read and watch a lot of science fiction and fantasy. I am particularly fond of near future dystopian scifi, 
                        such as William Gibson's Neuromancer. A lot of the concepts of Gibson's worlds are allready coming to life.
                        We are relying more on technology than ever, and there is a strong trend in the economy of catch up or lose. 
                        Of course traditional jobs are still very much around, 
                        but for anyone my age I would advice them not to rely on this being true all the way until retirement! </div>
